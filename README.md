Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry

  Is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality sofware systems.
  IMPORTANCE: It creates an enabling environment for the creation of software applications and systems that powers various aspects of modern life 
  including communications, commerce etc.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  The development of programming languages e.g Fortran,C was vital step to its development.
  The establishment of software as a discipline in the 1960's played a key role the evolution of software engineering as resources could be now be allocated
  to advance it's full potential.
  The advent of structured programming in the 1970's and rise of agile methodologies in 2000's played a key role its evolution through provision of 
step by step guidelines.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

  Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  Design- Creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
  Implementation- Writing a code  and building the software according to the design specifications
  Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the quqlity standards and funtional requirements.
  Deployment- Releasing the software to the users and customers.
  Maintenance- Involves provision ongoing support, updates and enhancements to software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

  Waterfall is sequential in approach with distinct phases e.g requirements, design, implementation flowing downwards like waterfall while 
  Agile uses iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

  Software Developer- Writes the code and implement software solutions.
  Quality Assurance- Designs and executes test plans to ensure software quqlity is met.
  Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

  IDEs provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g Visual Studio,Eclipse etc.
  VCS- This is a software tool thats helps in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

  Requirements may change during development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays.
  Tight deadlines i.e Pressure to deliver software products on time schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  Strategies to overcome include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular re-assesment of project goals 
and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    Unit Testing- Involves testing of individual components or modules of software.
    Integration Testing- Involves the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems.
    System Testing- Testing the entire system as a whole.
    Acceptance Testing- Testing softwre against user requirement to ensure it meets all the user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


  Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt Engineering is like creating a special recipe for your robot
  It helps you to get the correct answer much easy and faster.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.


  'Tell me about bread.' instead of 'Give me a step by step recipe for preparing bread'.
